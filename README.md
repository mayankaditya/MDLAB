MDLAB
Welcome to MDLAB, the post-processing tool that can help you simulate neutron and X-ray scattering experiments and calculate transport properties. With MDLAB, you can process LAMMPS, VASP, DL-POLY, and GPUMD trajectories. 

MDLAB offers a wide range of features that can help you get the most out of your simulations. You can use it to calculate mean squared displacement, phonon density of states, neutron-weighted phonon density of states, pair-distribution function, X-ray and neutron-weighted pair distribution function, anisotropic displacement pattern, Van-Hove correlation function, dynamical structure factor calculation powder-averaged S(Q, E), dynamics structure factor calculation single crystal, neutron/X-ray weighted S(Q, E), powder-averaged atomic-resolved quasi-elastic-neutron spectra, spectral energy density functional calculation, acoustic phonon dispersion in liquid/amorphous/crystalline materials, atomic-pair resolved diffuse scattering, neutron and X-ray weighted, atomic probability density function calculation, free energy landscape as a function of r with respect to the initial site, bond-angle distribution, polyhedral bond angle time dependence with respect to the unique axis, diffraction pattern, neutron/X-ray weighted diffraction pattern, velocity auto-correlation function, and diffusion coefficient (from VACF and MSD).

We are currently working on the code manual, which will be available soon.
